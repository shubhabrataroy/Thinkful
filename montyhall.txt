For simplicity let:
D1: The Event of Monty Hall opening door 1.
D2: The Event of Monty Hall opening door 2.
D3: The Event of Monty Hall opening door 3.
C1: The Event of finding the car behind door 1.
C2: The Event of finding the car behind door 2.
C3: The Event of finding the car behind door 3.


The prior probability of Monty Hall finding a car behind any door is obviously p(C#)=1/3, where P(C1)=P(C2)=P(C3)

Assuming you took the same decision as in the standard problem and you chose the door No.1.

So let's focus here on the 3rd Door!

The probability that Monty Hall opens door No.3. given the car is behind door No.1 is:
p(D3|C1) = 1/2 

We know also that Monty Hall will never open the door which has the car so the probability that Monty Hall opens door No.3.  given that the car is behind door No.3. is: 
p(D3|C3) = 0 

Contrary, the probability that Monty Hall opens door No.3. given the car is behind  door No.2. is: 
p(D3|C2) = 1 


Now to the Bayes's part: 

p(C1|D3)= p(D3|C1) * p(C1) / p(D3)
= (1/2 * 1/3) / (1/2)
= 1/3

p(C2|D3)= p(D3|C2) * p(C2) / p(D3)
= (1 * 1/3) / (1/2)
= 2/3

which thanks to Jeff Jo's comment can be even reduced to:
  = 1 / [p(D3|C1)+1] = 1/(1/2+1) = 2/3

therefore, if you choose No.1. initially and Monty Hall opens door No.3. to reveal that it has no car, the probability of a car standing behind door No.2. is 2/3. Therefore you should ALWAYS switch your selection of your initial door.

This paradox may confuse many people who may believe that the you have a 50:50 chance of winning the car in this situation whether by switching or not switching your choice.

This becomes more obvious to be not true when you scale the number of doors to a larger number like 100 instead of 3.
